## TODO  âœ… â¬œ

âœ… implement thumb drugging on mouse down

ðŸ†— do the packaging (works with textext when referenced locally for now). Install from github should work as well, but I did not tested it.

âœ… css is embedded to js so it is one reference to make it work

âœ… works without passing any elements, defaults to the whole page


â¬œ make sure that scrollbar is hidden when it is not needed. Eg. https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox

â¬œ make it work with infinite scroll e.g. twitter

â¬œ restore markers


âœ… â¬œ ðŸ†—
