### Vugluscr

Vugluscr is a scrollbar that quietly sits in the corner of the page or a scrollable container, waiting for you to do some scrolling or jumping around.

Unlike the standard browser scrollbar with vugluscr you can:

* Navigate to any point of the page with one click on the scrollbar track, while standard behavior is to scroll the length of one screen (client height)
* Add markers indicating positions of elements of your choice. Similar to the behavior to the behavior of many IDEs and text editors and how browsers indicate the position of search term occurrences.

*Work in progress, see also [TODO](TODO.md)*
